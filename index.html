            <p>
                I describe myself as someone who tries as hard as possible to achieve his goals.<br>
                I love computers and Computer Science major.
                I personally believe that by the help of computers and technologies, engineers and scientists are capable of making this world a better place to live, and they can make the lives of so many people in distinct parts of the world easier.<br>
                My main interests are <strong>Data Mining</strong>,
                <strong>Big Data</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong> and <strong>Computer Vision</strong>.
                I hope to play my role in this world as well as possible and help some people live a better day.
            </p>
            <p>
                During getting my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering, I strove to acquire some information about Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence in diverse ways.
                I have passed several AI-related courses, all with A's, and I have practiced this knowledge in a number of <a  onclick="show_projects()" class="non_underline-link blue-btn projects" href="#" >projects</a>.
                My current <strong>total GPA is 3.82 / 4 (18.22 / 20)</strong> and I got <strong>104 / 120 in TOEFL iBT Test</strong>.
                I ranked as Top 2% among more than 150,000 participants in National Entrance Exam for Undergraduate State Universities in Iran. I was chosen as an outstanding student at Amirkabir
                University of Technology, and I was eligible to study in two majors simultaneously.
                Amirkabir University of Technology gave me the opportunity of direct entry for Master of Science (without university entrance exam) in computer engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary goal is to pursue my education in a top-ranking university and conduct research as a member
                of an enthusiastic team. In this way, I hope to learn what is necessary and be able to create some new technologies in order to be helpful in this world.
